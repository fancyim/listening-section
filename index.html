                <h1>Our Approach</h1>
                <p>The mission of The Young Journalists is to nature intellectual 
                    curiosity and instill a lifelong love of writing by mentoring 
                    fourth and fifth-grade students in the creation of their very own 
                    published bylines.
                    Our mentors teach the "tools"of journalism: email, online research,
                    copying and pasting in Word, citing sources, downloading publishable images
                    creating a new broadcast, proper sentence structure, paraphrasing, grammar,
                    punctuation, vocabulary and most importantly, conceptualizing how the research will become
                    a published article. The students read out loud boigraphies of journalists 
                    such as Marjory Stoneman Douglas, E.B. White, Gwen Ifill, Hunter Thompson and Richard
                    Engel, to inspire them. This also educates them in journalism's many styles 
                    and helps them build a rich and exapansive vocabulary, which their writing.

              <p>The four categories of journalistic roles - normative, 
                cognitive, practiced, and narrated roles - correspond to conceptually
                distinct ideas: what they want to do, what they really do in practice,
